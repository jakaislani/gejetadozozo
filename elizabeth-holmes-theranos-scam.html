array of diagnoses via a simple finger prick.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the revolution was all smoke and mirrors: Theranos failed to produce a viable working product, deceiving investors, regulators, and partners for years, until collapsing in a sea of lawsuits and federal charges in 2018. Holmes was found guilty on four counts of defrauding investors in January 2022 and will begin <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/17/tech/elizabeth-holmes-bid-denied/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="serving an 11-year prison sentence" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">serving an 11-year prison sentence</a> on May 30, 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Investigations revealed the truth behind the sham, uncovering the utilization of dangerous health practices and misleading data, but the big question remains: How did Holmes keep the charade going for so many years?</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Holmes’ mission inspired powerful backers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Certainly, the company’s stated intent was a noble one: By replacing the uncomfortable needlework normally used for blood testing with a minimally invasive process, Theranos would make this aspect of healthcare quick, painless, and inexpensive. That, in turn, would make people more likely to seek care when needed, and potentially cut down on mortality rates. Holmes often told the story of her beloved uncle dying from cancer, wrapping with an inspiring message about saving the ones we love.</p><img alt="bill clinton speaks into a microphone while looking at and extending his arm out to elizabeth holmes who is looking at him and holding a microphone in her hands, both are sitting on a stage with a blue background behind them" title="Bill Clinton and Elizabeth Holmes in 2015" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bill-clinton-speaks-as-elizabeth-holmes-founder-and-ceo-of-theranos-listens-during-the-closing-session-of-the-clinton-global-initiative-2015-on-september-29-2015-in-new-york-city-photo-by-jp-yimgetty-.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Bill Clinton and Elizabeth Holmes speak during the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative on September 29, 2015, in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With that sort of sales pitch, it’s easy to see how Holmes reeled in wealthy investors like media mogul <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/rupert-murdoch data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rupert Murdoch" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Rupert Murdoch</a> and board members like former Secretary of State <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/henry-kissinger data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry Kissinger" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Henry Kissinger</a>. The all-star roster propped up the facade of legitimacy even as the walls were closing in.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">She captivated investors with her charisma</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After federal charges were filed, media coverage often focused on Holmes’ creepier traits—her wide eyes that never blink and her surprisingly husky voice which might or might not be fake—while overlooking the charisma that propelled her to the forefront of the relentlessly competitive tech industry. In a 2014 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New Yorker profile" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">New Yorker profile</a>, Kissinger spoke of Holmes’ “ethereal quality,” while former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, another distinguished board member, lauded her “big heart.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Employees were particularly susceptible to her charms: Chief Design Architect Ana Arriola described her as “energetic” with a conviction that “really shines through,” while company whistleblower Tyler Shultz recalled, “Elizabeth had this way of locking you in, and when she was talking to you, she made you feel like you were the most important person in her world right now and you were so important to achieving this vision that you were dedicated to.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Holmes idolized Steve Jobs and took a page from his playbook</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/steve-jobs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve Jobs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Steve Jobs</a> emerging as the Silicon Valley big cheese during the formative years of Theranos, Holmes modeled her life and leadership style like the Apple CEO in a way that bordered on obsessive. Along with adopting Jobs’ signature black turtleneck uniform, she stocked her company with former Apple staffers, used the same advertising agency as Apple, and referred to her blood-testing product as “iPod of healthcare.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In his 2018 book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525431993 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup" data-vars-ga-product-id=6e61f9e6-83db-4efc-b1b8-a47066fbb99a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525431993 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525431993 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525431993 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Vintage data-vars-ga-product-price=$11.45 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=717cc52c-986e-4134-98bd-d4fbdfaaba36 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Vintage class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1aq0z090">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a>, John Carreyrou described how Theranos employees recognized which chapter Holmes was reading in a biography of Jobs based on her management technique du jour. He also relayed the anecdote of how Holmes brought work to a standstill on the day her idol died in 2011, over efforts to find a suitable flag with which to honor him.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">She fostered an atmosphere of secrecy and intimidation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Theranos infamously kept FDA regulators at arm’s length by submitting testing results from other laboratories, not its own machines. But the secrecy also extended inward. From the very beginning, employees noted the constant turnover and how divisions were sequestered from one another instead of functioning in unison. Another whistleblower, Erika Cheung, recalled the “barriers” set up in the office lab, preventing workers from seeing the devices they were ostensibly creating.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Additionally, Holmes and her boyfriend, Theranos president and COO Sunny Balwari, carefully policed the company to keep dissenters in line. One prize pickup from Apple, Jobs’ right-hand man Avie Tevanian, was pressured to resign from the board after questioning the many failed processes. And prior to quitting the company, Shultz wrote an email to Holmes that expressed his concerns, only to receive a threatening, insulting reply from Balwari.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Holmes kept her eye on the prize</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Holmes continued to display a relentlessly upbeat persona over the final months of Theranos, which helped secure late-stage funding but also produced a distorted reality at the office. According to a February 2019 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/inside-elizabeth-holmess-final-months-at-theranos data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair article" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Vanity Fair article</a>, Holmes would approach employees who had just testified before the SEC and engage them as if nothing was amiss. Symbolizing her optimism, she acquired a Siberian husky puppy and named him Balto, after a sled dog who once braved a hazardous trek across Alaska with an antitoxin to fight a diphtheria outbreak.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even after the company dissolved and she was indicted on 11 counts of fraud, Holmes, who pleaded not guilty, still believed in her heroic vision: When she was approached to appear in a documentary about her rise and fall, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXGWJ8wyZ-K2uAwEAAAAK data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley" data-vars-ga-product-id=0c11d2b1-957e-4dd4-8b52-d1c8821ed5de data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXGWJ8wyZ-K2uAwEAAAAK data-product-url=https://www.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXGWJ8wyZ-K2uAwEAAAAK data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Ffeature%2Furn%3Ahbo%3Afeature%3AGXGWJ8wyZ-K2uAwEAAAAK" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=hbomax.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5de807a4-e674-4b91-a964-13ce49bae93c data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=hbomax.com class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1aq0z090">The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley</a>, she told producers that she was in the process of getting more funding, and suggested they come back when things were rolling again.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Heading for prison</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During her trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Holmes attempted to discredit testimony from whistleblowers and critics and took to the stand in her own defense.
