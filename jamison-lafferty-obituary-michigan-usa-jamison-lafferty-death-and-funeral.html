been impacted by the tragic hit-and-run accident that occurred on Tuesday night. In light of the recent passing of Jamison Lafferty, 14, the son of Alee and Justin Lafferty, a member of the community has been given permission by the Lafferty family to set up and publicize an online donation page for a meal train in the family’s name.</p><p>The Daily News attempted to get in touch with Dakin, who is a registered nurse at Corewell Health Greenville Hospital. Upon hearing about the family’s situation, Dakin stated that she wanted to assist them in any way that she could. “Growing up in this community and going to school with Jamison’s mom and aunt, knowing his grandmother and all the amazing things she’s done in this community, seeing such a beautiful family Alee and Justin have raised, you just want to help them because that could have been any of us,” Dakin said.</p><p>“Growing up in this community and going to school with Jamison’s grandmother and all the wonderful things she’s done in this community.” “The death of a child is a tragedy, and in addition, we have two other children who were injured.” Everyone in the neighborhood is in a state of mourning. When compared to a smaller community, this is significant. Therefore, anything that helps lighten the load they have to carry in the days ahead will be of assistance. Right now, all of us simply need to be the people that we would need in times of desperation.</p><p>Jamison, who turned 14 on Friday, would have started the eighth grade at Greenville Middle School this coming autumn. Jamison recently celebrated his birthday on Friday. Jamison was reportedly a close friend of Dakin’s daughter Gabby, who also attends Greenville Middle School and is also in the eighth grade. This past summer was when Dakin first got to meet Jamison, and the encounter left an indelible mark on him.</p><p>“He was just so kind and respectful, a good friend, and a nice kid to talk to — to know him was to love him,” she added. “To know him was to love him.” “He was an exceptionally talented athlete. He was ambitious while maintaining his humility. He made a lot of friends because to his involvement at the Greenville Community Church, where his mother is employed. Gabby claimed that she was unaware of any other children that did not get along with him.</p><p>In her statement, Dakin said that while the community is invited to make donations, she hopes that they will also respect the privacy of the Lafferty family. She stated that the family and the requirements they have should be the primary concern because “this is completely about the family.” Concerning the large number of children and teachers who have been adversely affected by the tragedy, Greenville Public Schools Superintendent Wayne Roedel stated that attempts have been made to provide additional support during this difficult time.</p><p>“Montcalm Care Network is providing support to grieving individuals, and (middle school principal) Mary Beth (Taylor) and her middle school team are working as well to provide a support network for adults and students,” he stated in an email to staff members. “Montcalm Care Network” Roedel continued by saying that further resources will continue to be provided no matter how the scenario evolves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCmoKynnmK5orLFnqmtsV2kr6rA1JqpsmWdnrCptcaapWato5Z6q63Moqqopl2hrqeyxKursmWUmq61tIyapZ1llqq7pr7ApWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./anupama-written-update-6-july-2023-todays-episode-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Anupama Written Update 6 July 2023: Todays Episode</a>
