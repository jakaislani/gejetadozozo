Time flew by due to world class storytelling, with MJF playing the conniving and cheating heel and CM Punk going on the offensive as a fearless hometown hero.</p><p>Punk’s selling of his arm and leg were great, and MJF’s psychology targeting Punk’s limbs was world class. The false finish followed up by MJF winning for a second time in one match was a massive shock too.
