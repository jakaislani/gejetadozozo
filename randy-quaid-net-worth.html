He was also fined $81,572 by the union for his actions in Seattle, the equivalent of two weeks' salary for the cast; all 26 members of the cast brought charges against Quaid, maintaining that he "physically and verbally abused his fellow performers and that his oddball behavior forced the show to close." Another major issue was Randy's costume, over which he insisted he had final approval (he dyed his hair beet red and wore a codpiece the size and shape of an official N.F.L. football). Reacting to Equity's decision, Quaid said, "I am guilty of only one thing: Giving a performance that elicited a response so deeply felt by the actors and producers with little experience of my creative process that they actually think I am Falstaff.".

Brokeback Mountain, whose three Oscars included Best Director for Ang Lee, topped $82 million at the domestic box office. Quaid had been seeking at least $10 million but later dropped the lawsuit in May of 2006.
