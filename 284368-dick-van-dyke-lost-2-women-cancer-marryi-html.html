Still, they married on an ABC radio show called "Bride and Groom" in 1948.</p><p class=Wg>Van Dyke and Willett moved to Malibu, and she got pregnant with twins.

Still, Willett preferred a quiet life and spent most of her time in the family's Arizona ranch.</p><p class=Wg>In 1976, after being together for over three decades, Van Dyke and Willett parted ways.
